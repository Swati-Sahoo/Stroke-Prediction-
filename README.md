# Stroke-Prediction-
An intelligent medical decision-support tool that predicts the risk of stroke based on clinical and lifestyle data using a machine learning model trained on real-world healthcare data.

This project aims to assist healthcare professionals and patients in **early stroke risk assessment** using an interactive console-based input system and an accurate prediction engine built with Random Forest and SMOTE balancing.
## Overview

Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Predicting stroke early can help prevent severe outcomes and improve survival chances.

This project implements:
A machine learning pipeline that cleans data, handles class imbalance, and trains a model.
A real-time user interaction system that accepts **age, glucose level, hypertension**, and more.
Model evaluation using robust metrics: "Accuracy" and "AUC Score".
## Features

Real-world dataset from the healthcare domain
Data preprocessing and encoding of categorical variables
Class imbalance handled with "SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)"
Uses "Random Forest Classifier" for high accuracy
Interactive console input system for real-time stroke risk prediction
Model evaluated with **Accuracy** and **AUC** on test data
##  Dataset

###Target variable: `stroke` (0 = no stroke, 1 = stroke)
####Features**:
`age`, `hypertension`, `heart_disease`, `avg_glucose_level`, `bmi`
 `gender`, `ever_married`, `work_type`, `Residence_type`, `smoking_status`
